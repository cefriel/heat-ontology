## Ontology purpose and scope

The Human Evaluation and Assessment Tools Ontology (HEAT) models concepts relevanto to the construction of questionnaires that assess the user's subjective experience, like tools, reference theories, contexts, and constructs, with their questions and answers.

HEAT reuses state-of-the-art ontologies including DCMI Metadata Terms, BIBO, PROV-O, and the Survey Ontology. 

For designing the ontology, we adopted the [Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology](https://zenodo.org/records/2539305).
