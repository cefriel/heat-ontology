<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The HEAT (Human Evaluation and Assessment Tools) ontology addresses the human evaluation and assessment tools domain. 

It models the relationships among theories, constructs, measurement items, and application contexts, enabling a comprehensive navigation and comparison across diverse quantitative assessment instruments such as usability scales, technology acceptance models, and cognitive workload measures. 

Designed to support both practitioners and researchers, HEAT facilitates the identification, selection, and reuse of validated evaluation tools, while allowing for extensibility and integration of new resources.

HEAT reuses state-of-the-art ontologies including the [Bibliographic Ontology (BIBO)](https://github.com/dcmi/bibo), the [Survey Ontology (SUR)](https://w3id.org/survey-ontology#), the [Provenance Ontology (PROV-O)](http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#), and the [DCMI Metadata Terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/).

To design the ontology, we adopted the [Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology](https://zenodo.org/records/2539305).</span>
